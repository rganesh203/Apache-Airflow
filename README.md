Introduction to Data Pipeline
   It will work to build high grade data pipelines from reusable tasks that can be
monitored and provide easy backfills for a music streaming company, Sparkify. They will move JSON logs
of user activity and JSON metadata data from S3 and process it in Sparkify’s data warehouse in Amazon
Redshift. To complete the project, learners will need to create their own custom operators to perform tasks
such as staging the data, filling the data warehouse, and running checks on the data as the final step.

Reasons To Choose & Not Choose Airflow
    Choosing Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration has several advantages and some considerations to keep in mind:
    Reasons to Choose Airflow:
    1.	Flexibility and Extensibility: Airflow allows you to define workflows as code, making it highly flexible and customizable. You can integrate it with various services and platforms, adapting it to different use cases.
    2.	Rich Ecosystem: It has a large and active community contributing plugins and integrations, which can extend its capabilities significantly.
    3.	Scalability: Airflow is designed to handle scalable workflows and can manage a large number of tasks with dependencies.
    4.	Monitoring and Alerting: Built-in monitoring tools and alerting mechanisms help you track workflow execution and respond to failures or delays.
    5.	Dynamic Workflows: It supports dynamic task generation and parameterization, which is useful for complex workflows that vary in structure or size over time.
    6.	Version Control: Workflows defined in Airflow are version-controlled, allowing you to track changes and revert if needed.
    Reasons to Not Choose Airflow:
    1.	Learning Curve: Airflow has a steep learning curve, especially for those new to workflow orchestration tools or Python-based frameworks.
    2.	Resource Intensive: Setting up Airflow requires resources (like servers or containers) and some operational overhead for maintenance and monitoring.
    3.	Complexity in Setup: Configuring Airflow for production environments can be complex, involving considerations like database setups, security configurations, and scaling strategies.
    4.	Real-time Processing: While Airflow can handle near real-time workflows, it may not be the best fit for use cases requiring ultra-low latency or sub-second processing times.
    5.	Alternative Tools: Depending on specific needs (e.g., simpler workflows, specific integrations), there might be more lightweight or specialized tools that could be more suitable.
    When considering Airflow, it's important to evaluate these factors against your project requirements and team's expertise to make an informed decision.


Define and describe a data pipeline and its usage.
• Explain the relationship between DAGs, S3, and Redshift within a given example.
• Employ tasks as instantiated operators.
• Organize task dependencies based on logic flow.
• Apply templating in codebase with kwargs parameter to set runtime variables.
• Create Airflow Connection to AWS using AWS credentials.
• Create Postgres/Redshift Airflow Connections.
• Leverage hooks to use Connections in DAGs.
• Connect S3 to a Redshift DAG programmatically.
• Utilize the logic flow of task dependencies to investigate potential errors within data lineage.
• Leverage Airflow catchup to backfill data.
• Extract data from a specific time range by employing the kwargs parameters.
• Create a task to ensure data quality within select tables.
• Consolidate repeated code into operator plugins.
• Refactor a complex task into multiple tasks with separate SQL statements.
• Convert an Airflow 1 DAG into an Airflow 2 DAG.
• Construct a DAG and custom operator end-to-end
